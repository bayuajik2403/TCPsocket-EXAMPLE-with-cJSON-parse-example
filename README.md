# Hello

This is an example on how to create a TCP socket, I learn to make socket from this [socket programming]{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/} tutorial and modified it a bit. And also I include the explanation of socket in the workfile to make it easier to understand for someone just started.

I add cJSON to parse a JSON and the purpose is to execute 'something' when the command sent from CLIENT is recognized by server.

You can find how to compile in compile.txt in each folder. Basically use gcc and g++.
